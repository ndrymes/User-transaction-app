# App Test

The task is to build a transaction app that debits and credit a single user

# Get Started

- Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/ndrymes/User-transaction-app.git
- Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all app dependencies
- Make a copy of the sample.env file and rename to .env
- Start the app at the root directory using
  - `npm run dev` for development
  - `npm run start` for production

## To run the app via docker

```
docker-compose up

```
# Demo

The app is hosted on heroku. The base url is <a href="https://immense-stream-85373.herokuapp.com/">https://immense-stream-85373.herokuapp.com/</a>.
The default endpoint is an health check endpoint that returns a success response.

## API

# Project Structure

![file structure](https://i.ibb.co/KVyzY5C/structure.png)

# Libraries Used

- Mocha - For running unit tests
- Restidy - Popular framework with a lean set of features for running apps
- Jest - For testing purpose

# Todo

I had a lot of fun building this but there are some improvements I can still make:

- More tests, especially  unit tests for all other services and integration using super test.
- Add a dependency injection library like awilix to handle injection of dependencies
- Include a makefile to ease the execution of some common tasks

# Testing

- To run the tests, simply type `npm test`
- We can also get code coverage by `npm run coverage`

Thank you üëç
